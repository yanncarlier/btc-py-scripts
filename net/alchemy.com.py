"""Look up a Bitcoin address balance through Alchemy.

.. warning::
    Alchemy's Bitcoin API (https://www.alchemy.com/) is a **JSON-RPC node
    relay** that mirrors the standard Bitcoin Core RPC interface
    (``getblock``, ``getrawtransaction``, ``gettxout``, etc.).  Bitcoin Core
    deliberately does **not** index the blockchain by address, so there is no
    method to query the balance of an arbitrary address through this API.

    This script raises a ``RuntimeError`` on every invocation to make that
    limitation explicit.  The file is kept alongside the other ``net/``
    scripts for reference and completeness.

    If you need address-based balance lookups with an API key-gated service,
    see ``cryptoapis.io.py`` instead.
